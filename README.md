BE Mod 2 Pair Project

# Welcome to Adopt Don't Shop!

Please look around at the pets available for adoption at our various shelters. 

If you are interested in adoption, please add your favorite furry pals to your favorites and when you're ready to apply you can complete an application on the favorites page. 

For our existing customers who have already visited us or taken a new best friend home, please leave a review so others can hear about your experience! 

We look forward to seeing you and hopefully find a match so our amazing pets can find their forever home!
